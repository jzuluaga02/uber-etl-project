# Data Engineering using an ETL pipeline for an Uber Dataset

The primary aim of this project is to delve into the realm of data analytics through an in-depth exploration of Uber's extensive dataset. Leveraging a comprehensive toolkit comprised of cutting-edge tools and technologies, the project centers around extracting valuable insights from the dataset to illuminate patterns, trends, and correlations.

# Dataset

The dataset for TLC Trip Record Data encompasses both yellow and green taxi trips, containing attributes that capture information such as the dates and times of pick-up and drop-off, the locations for pick-up and drop-off, the distances traveled during the trips, detailed fare breakdowns, different rate categories, methods of payment, and passenger counts reported by the drivers.

The dataset was obtained from:  https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page and more information about the data can be found at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf
